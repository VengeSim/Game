-ADD Gridindex points in a circle for gravity rotations
-X,Y topdown Z = Depth
-combine camera properties into one 'direction' data that can be used to determine facing and rotation
	eg. facing [0,1,2] with negitives. line 54


facing determines what dimension is displayed on the horizontal and vertical, and the position of 0
facing with 0 rotation
horizontal, vertical
x,y Down	(1,1,0)
x,z forward (1,0,1)
x,-y up		(1,-1,0)
-x,z back	(-1,0,1)
y,z left	(0,1,1)
-y,z right	(0,-1,1)
rotation
0	= h,v 
90	= -v,h
180 = -h,-v
270 = v,-h

||ch*ca		||-ch*sa*cb + sh*sb		||ch*sa*sb + sh*cb
||sa		||ca*cb					||-ca*sb
||-sh*ca	||sh*sa*cb + ch*sb		||-sh*sa*sb + ch*cb

sa = sin(attitude)
ca = cos(attitude)
sb = sin(bank)
cb = cos(bank)
sh = sin(heading)
ch = cos(heading)

- added all the rotationData basics, gotta work out how to display front view.

8/7/18 
- added hack ? in gridindex this[] // replace with a method

9/7/18
- facing is working
- bankleft is really attitude up
- need to work out dimension direction
- need to specify viewport better. work out a way to get z. maybe make port a 3d array.

10/7/18
- added rotateAround to gridIndex
- in the middle of changint matrix to matrix3d
- my matrix doesnt add to its self in order properly

11/7/18
- removed old matrix and added new class Matrix3D
- matrix tests ok

12/7/18
- region >> zone >> sector >> grindIndex
